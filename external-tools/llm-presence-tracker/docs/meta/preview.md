**1. Improve Snippet Quality**

Enhance the snippet quality by incorporating more engaging and informative content in the first paragraph. Currently, the first paragraph is 214 characters long and lacks a strong call to action. Consider revising it to include keywords like "resize image online" and "photo resizer free" to better align with user search queries. For example: "Quickly resize your images online for free with Adobe Express. Upload your photo, select your desired dimensions, and download the resized image instantly. Perfect for social media, websites, and more."

**2. Add More FAQs**

While the page already includes some FAQs, adding more can improve answerability and address common user concerns. Currently, there are 5 question headings. Consider adding questions like:
- "Is the Adobe Express image resizer free to use?"
- "What file formats are supported for resizing?"
- "How to resize an image for email or web use?"

These questions align with user intent and common queries related to image resizing.

**3. Enhance Freshness**

The page's freshness score is low at 24%. To improve this, ensure that the content reflects the current year (2025) and includes any recent updates or features of the tool. For example, update any references to new functionalities or user interface changes that have occurred recently. Additionally, consider adding a section that highlights any new features or improvements made to the image resizer tool.

**4. Introduce Comparisons**

Currently, there are no comparisons on the page. Adding a comparison section can help users understand the benefits of using Adobe Express over other image resizers. Consider adding an H2 heading like "Why Choose Adobe Express Over Other Image Resizers?" and include a comparison of features, ease of use, and pricing (if applicable).

**5. Optimize Structured Data**

While structured data is present, ensure it is fully optimized to enhance search engine visibility. Review the current structured data markup to ensure it accurately reflects the page content and includes all relevant information, such as user ratings, tool features, and FAQs. This can improve the page's snippet quality and overall discoverability in search results.
